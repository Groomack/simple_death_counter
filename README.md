## How to use?
1. Download the **widget** folder from repository.
1. Next, you need to run the the file *death_counter.py* from **widget** folder. Use for that **IDLE, PyCharm** or any.   
(I wanted to make the widget open from a single executable file or something similar. But my skills were not enough to do this:disappointed:)
3. Run OBS and add new Source Text(GDI+)
